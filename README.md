### Overview

Curious to finally put my hands on CSS3 `animation` and `transform3d` I've decided that it was time to dabble in it. 
I also wanted to benchmark the performance in modern browsers (Safari, Chrome & Firefox).

If you want to recompile scss file you have to have [**compass 0.13.alpha**](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass) installed:

	 gem install compass -v=0.13.alpha.0

or

	 gem install compass --pre
